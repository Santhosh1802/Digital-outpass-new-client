              Fill out the form to request an outpass for leaving the campus.
              <br />
              <br />
              Guidelines for filling the form:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Single Request per Day: You can request only one outpass per
              day.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. Out Time: The selected out time must be later than the current
              time.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. In Time: The selected in time must be later than the out time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Review your details carefully before submitting the request.
              <br />

              This page displays the status of your most recent outpass request.
              <br />
              <br />
              Status Types:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. Pending: Your request is under review and waiting for approval.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. Accepted: Your request is approved, and you can now access the
              QR code in the View QR page.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. Rejected: Your request is denied. Check the reason, if any, and
              resubmit if necessary.
              <br />

              This page provides the QR code required to verify your outpass at
              the campus gate.
              <br />
              <br />
              Guidelines for using the QR code:
              <br />
              <br />
              1. When your request status changes to Accepted, the QR code
              becomes visible.
              <br />
              <br />
              2. Leaving the Campus: Use the QR code at the campus gate to
              verify your outpass and exit.
              <br />
              <br />
              3. Re-entering the Campus: Use the same QR code to verify and
              enter the campus.
              <br />
              <br />
              4. QR Code Validity: The QR code has a time-bound validity.
              <br />
              <br />
              5. Use the Refresh QR button to refresh the code if it is not
              valid anymore.
              <br />
              <br />
              6. If you have already left the campus, refreshing the QR code
              will not
              <br />
              generate a new one for exitingâ€”it will only verify re-entry.
